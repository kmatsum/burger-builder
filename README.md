## Burger Builder

A React Web App for me to explore React and learn the ins and outs of React and JavaScript

### Building a Burger

One of the main features is to create your own customized burger by changing the ingredients you select.<br />
The ingredients you select will change the price of the burger<br />

### Viewing your Cart

Once you order a Burger, it will be added to your cart so you can see past burger orders and what was contained in each burger.<br />

### Libraries Used
- Redux / React-Redux
- Redux Thunk - Async Redux Action Library
- React Router - Website Routing Library
- Axios - HTTP Request Management Library

### Technologies Used
- Git / GitHub (Version Control)
- Google Firebase: This acted as a pseudo-backend for the application, storing product and order information, as well as hold User Authentication for this application.
- REST APIs: Google Consumed the Google Firebase REST APIs to GET, PUT and POST data to the "backend servers"
